# Voting-result-prediction-using-Weka
Classifying United States congressional voting result based on different attributes to predict future voters. Weka data mining software were used.

I have successfully implemented classification algorithms based on 1984 United States Congressional Voting Records to predict future voters’ class which could be “Democrat” or “Republican”.

Based on accuracy, runtime and other key features, I have also ranked the best (Decision tree: C4.5_Unpruned tree), the second best (Multilayer Perceptron function Classifier) & the third best classification (Decision tree: C4.5_Pruned tree) algorithm.

These high accurate classifier algorithms will be very helpful to classify future voters to predict their preferred team to vote.
